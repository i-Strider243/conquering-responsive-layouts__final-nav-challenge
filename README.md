## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt how to make a responsive nav bar with a toggle button. I also learnt to use classes for styling. I further gained more knowledge on the various CSS Units e.g rem, em, and their use cases.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive navbar tutorial using HTML CSS & JS](https://youtu.be/HbBMp6yUXO0) - This helped me to make the toggle button responsive using Data Attribute, I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [How to detect on click outside div with javascript](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/on+click+outside+div+javascript) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to detect a click outside an element. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
